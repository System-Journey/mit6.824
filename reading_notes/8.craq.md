# Object Storage on CRAQ: High-throughput chain replication for read-mostly workloads

+ strong consistency + read operation served by each replica

## Question

> Item 4 in Section 2.3 says that, if a client read request arrives and the latest version is dirty, the node should ask the tail for the latest committed version. Suppose, instead, that the node replied with its most recent clean version (ignoring any dirty version and not sending a version query to the tail). This change would cause reads to reflect the most recent committed write that the node is aware of. Explain how this could lead to violations of linearizability -- or violations of the paper's goal of strong consistency.

可能tail已经提交某个dirty版本，但是ack没有传到当前节点。因此返回给client的是stale数据，因此违反了strong consistency。
