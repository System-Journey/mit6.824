### consistency guarantee

1. linearizable writes: 全局所有写有序
2. FIFO client order: 单个client的读写按FIFO有序，即单个client的读一定能看到其之前的写，但不能保证其它client的写一定能看见。

## Question

```
One use of Zookeeper is as a fault-tolerant lock service (see the section "Simple locks" on page 6). Why isn't possible for two clients to acquire the same lock? In particular, how does Zookeeper decide if a client has failed and it can give the client's locks to other clients?
```

+ 锁对应namespace中一个目录，该目录下的每个client对应一个结构体，只有该目录下序号最小的client能获得锁，其它client都锁在序列号比其小的前一个client上。
