# In Search of an Understandable Consensus Algorithm: Raft II

# Question

Could a received InstallSnapshot RPC cause the state machine to go backwards in time? That is, could step 8 in Figure 13 cause the state machine to be reset so that it reflects fewer executed operations? If yes, explain how this could happen. If no, explain why it can't happen.

This cannot happend since Raft RPCs are idempotent, based on the *last included index*, *last included term* in the snapshot and the *commitIndex* in the receiver, the receiver can determine wheter or not reset its own state.
